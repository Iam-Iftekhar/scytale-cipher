**scytale** (pronounced "sit-ah-lee").  It's a form of **transposition cipher** used by the ancient Spartans.

### How the Scytale Works

The process is exactly as you described:

1.  A strip of parchment, leather, or cloth is wrapped around a cylindrical staff called a scytale.
2.  The sender writes the message lengthwise along the staff. The letters of each word are written on adjacent turns of the strip.
3.  The strip is then unwrapped, and the message appears as a scrambled sequence of letters.
4.  To decrypt the message, the recipient must wrap the strip around a scytale of the exact same diameter as the one used by the sender.

The key to the cipher isn't a secret word or code, but the **diameter of the stick**, which determines the number of characters per turn of the spiral. Without a stick of the correct diameter, the message is unreadable. This method is an early example of a cryptographic key that is a physical object rather than a piece of information.
